### how to keep the source of truth in dotfiles in wsl
# clone dotfiles in windows file system like `%appdata%/dotfiles-for-win`
#
# symlink from windows via `cd %appdata%\alacritty && mklink alarcritty.yml ..\dotfiles-for-win\alacritty.win.yml`
# then now tracking and applying can be done with one file thanks to symlinks
#
# symlink from wsl `ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[windows username]/Roaming/dotfiles-for-win` (so that I can edit dotfiles on wsl)
# keep one dotfiles on windows and one dotfiles on wsl and sync via git when necessary for better disk performance on wsl
