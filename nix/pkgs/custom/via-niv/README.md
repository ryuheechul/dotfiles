# via-niv
It's a helper to track repos and pin versions for [../../custom](../../custom).

Use [Makefile](./Makefile) to get help on usages

## Difference Between This One and niv-shim
[../../../niv-shim](../../../niv-shim) is mostly for "system wide"
and this one is for serving `custom` only

Using `niv` it's flexible to place it in anywhere but I don't one to place everything at one place nor so many different places.
So I'm balancing between too little and too many.
