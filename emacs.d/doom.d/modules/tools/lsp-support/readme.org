#+title: Readme - lsp-support

* Why I chose =eglot= over =lsp-mode= or =lsp-bridge=?

** long story short:
- eglot works the best with in terms of the consistency between local and tramp mode and with other two (=lsp-mode= and =lsp-bridge=), I found them not working well with tramp
- and tramp usage is very importan to me

** a bit longer
*** =lsp-mode=
**** it was quite featureful out of the box but ...
**** [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/1845][[GH Issue] lsp starting stuck when open tramp file. #1845]]
*** [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge?tab=readme-ov-file#remote-usage][=lsp-bridge='s remote usage]] is not based on tramp
**** it was quite performant which is good but ...
**** and this also doesn't seem to make use of =~/.ssh/config= (then it ignores =$SSH_AUTH_SOCK=)
***** further more can't use domain name in =~/.ssh/config= ...
*** =eglot= is the built-in choice but lacks the support of multiple language servers at the same time
**** TODO but there seems to be a workaround being discussed, https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1429
**** [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/eglot-booster][eglot-booster]] makes it very easy to make use of =emacs-lsp-booster=

*** since it's only the beginning of adapting LSP on Emacs for me, I might change my setup later on but at least this is the initial version of the most optimal setup that make sense to me

** so what's the criteria I'm looking for?
- least sluggish possible
  - hence =emacs-lsp-booster= and =eglot-booster= and considering =lsp-bridge=
- easily configurable and extendible
- editing via tramp feels just like the local one (besides the inevitable but small enough latencies on LSP actions)
  - this is actually the motivation for me to try out emacs with tramp instead of my most familiar approach (SSH with Neovim)
    - I'm very comfortable with Neovim and it's great but typing (and echoing) every letter with variable latencies got me searching for better solution
      - tried mosh but it had many issues for me enough that I stopped trying
  - hopefully Emacs with Tramp can rock the remote coding for me but we will see!
