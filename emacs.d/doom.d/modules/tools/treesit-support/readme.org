#+title: Readme - treesit-support

This module is a way to bridge the gap between [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/tree/master/modules/tools/tree-sitter][the old way]] and the lack of support for the new way in the doom yet.

Therefore, powering the support for tree-sitter via =treesit= until this issue, https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/issues/7623 is resolved.
