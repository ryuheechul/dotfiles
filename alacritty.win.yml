### how to keep the source of truth in dotfiles in wsl
# clone dotfiles in windows file system like `%appdata%/dotfiles`
#
# symlink from windows `cd %appdata%\Roaming\alacritty.yml && mklink ../dotfiles/alacritty.win.yml
# then now tracking and applying can be done with one file thanks to symlinks
#
# symlink from wsl `ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[username]/Roaming/dotfiles ~/dotfiles` (so that I can edit dotfiles on wsl)
# if to manage only one dotfiles repo locally but this is actually not good for performance
# so it's better to have one dotfiles on windows and one dotfiles on wsl and sync via git when necessary
