# We know
That running apps with docker is great that it is portable and works pretty much the same with any device.

# But Why This Doc?

But because a container is a effectively a different "remote" machine, it is a lot harder to setup two things at least:
- language servers aka LSP to assist for reading and writing code
- debuggers aka DAP to take advantage of debugging process with breakpoints

# How it works? What do I need?
Well first of all, it is only possible thanks to all the tools and awesome plugins.
## LSP

### Tl;dr: 
- ./lua/plugins/lsp.lua
- ./lua/plugins/config/lsp-servers.lua

### Explanation

TBC

## DAP


### Tl;dr: 
- ./lua/plugins/debug.lua
- ./lua/plugins/config/dap.lua

### Explanation

# Examples

After many attempts to understand how things actually work and setup neovim to work with remote containers, I came up with few examples.

## LSP

### 1. nodejs
### 2. python



## DAP

### 1. nodejs
### 2. python
