# ftdetect
## about [./all.lua](./all.lua)
- this used to be `../ftdetect/detect.vim`, however [that stopped working after sometime](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23522)
- hence it will piggy back on `../plugin/ftdetect.lua` directory for the time being
- reverting back to `../ftdetect/all.lua` after discovered what caused the break
